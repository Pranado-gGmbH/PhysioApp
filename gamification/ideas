# Ideas for Gamification

Goal is to motivate the user to change their behavior. In principle we need to separate the cases of the injured patient who is working his or her way back to health and the user who seeks to prevent an injury from occuring in the first place. The reasons for separating has to do with group dynamics. We do not want to reward a group for having more injuries than other groups.

## Preventative
Form teams of employees, either in different groups or departments or companies. Reward the group for completing all the required exercises as a whole. Counting steps for the team would reward the larger team. Instead, what percentage of team members completed the daily requirement of exercises. This eliminates the advantage a larger team would have.
